# dictionary-website-boomerang
A dictionary website implemented with Boomerang

In this project, I use my Boomerang system -- github.com/michaellaszlo/boomerang -- to rewrite my PHP dictionary site -- github.com/michaellaszlo/dictionary-website-php -- into a similar set of templates that use the Go language in place of PHP.
