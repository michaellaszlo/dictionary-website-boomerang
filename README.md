# dictionary-website-boomerang

## A dictionary website implemented with Boomerang

This repository contains a remake of a [dictionary
website](https://github.com/michaellaszlo/dictionary-website-php) that was
written in PHP. The new website is visually and functionally identical to
the old one. The difference is that it was written with the [Boomerang
web template system](https://github.com/michaellaszlo/boomerang), which
uses the [Go language](https://golang.org/).
